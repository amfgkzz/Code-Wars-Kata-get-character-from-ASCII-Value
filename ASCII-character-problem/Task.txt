Write a function get_char() / getChar() which takes a number and returns the corresponding ASCII char for that value.

From Wikipedia:
ASCII, abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, 
and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.
