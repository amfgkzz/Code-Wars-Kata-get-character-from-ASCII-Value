Write a function that when given a URL as a string, parses out just the domain name and returns it as a string. For example:

domainName("http://github.com/carbonfive/raygun") == "github" 
domainName("http://www.zombie-bites.com") == "zombie-bites"
domainName("https://www.cnet.com") == "cnet"

Thought process:
would a regex be possible?
would I have to iterate over the string and cut out the domain name?
how to isolate the domain name is the question
many variations of domain name endings, ie .com, .org, etc
only possible choices to start a url are: www., http://, http://www., https://, https:www., and having only the domain name ie google.com
I'm thinking of creating a switch case with all the variations of starting a url
 - how would I isolate the 

research on URLs
 - consist of different parts
    - scheme / protocol : examples: http, https
    - sub-domain : examples: www, blog, honestly the sub-domain can be anything
    - domain : github.com, google.com

most consistent outlier are the two dots, example: www.domain.com
only have to watchout for the url's that start out with domain name already, example: domain.com
