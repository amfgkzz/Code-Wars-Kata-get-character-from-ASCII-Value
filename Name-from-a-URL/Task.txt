Write a function that when given a URL as a string, parses out just the domain name and returns it as a string. For example:

domainName("http://github.com/carbonfive/raygun") == "github" 
domainName("http://www.zombie-bites.com") == "zombie-bites"
domainName("https://www.cnet.com") == "cnet"

Thought process:
would a regex be possible?
would I have to iterate over the string and cut out the domain name?
how to isolate the domain name is the question
many variations of domain name endings, ie .com, .org, etc

research on URLs
 - consist of different parts
    - scheme / protocol : examples: http, https
    - sub-domain : examples: www, blog, honestly the sub-domain can be anything
    - domain : github.com, google.com

most consistent outlier are the two dots, example: www.domain.com
have to watchout for the url's that start out with domain name, example: domain.com 
have to watchout for the url's that start out with scheme and domain name, example: http://github.com/carbonfive/raygun 

After thoughts:
Flawed task was given in codewars, completed it anyway but function will only work on URL's with www. sub-domains 
or URL's with no sub-domains
